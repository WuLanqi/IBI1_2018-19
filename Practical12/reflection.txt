It took me almost 6 hours to complete this practical. I thought it was not easy.  
I made several mistakes in the random choice function and I did not realize them until I was coding next two tasks. 
I enjoyed coding the process of infection and recovery by using for loop and if statement. 
I was stuck in plotting different results into one figure and I turned to classmates for help. 
In spatial_SIR experiment, I refined my code according to offered “infection_snippet.py” file because I did not think of the problem of range.
