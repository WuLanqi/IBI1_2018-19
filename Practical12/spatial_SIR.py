for each time point:
    find infected points using where() function
    
    for each infected point in infected points:
        get x, y coordinates
        find its 8 neighbours (x-1~x+1,y-1~y+1)
        find x:
            find y:
                if (x,y) is not the infected point:
                    if (x,y) is not out of range:
                        if (x,y) is susceotible, not infected or not recovered:
                            random choice 0(p=1-beta) or 1(p=beta) and change the value of this point
                            (0 represents susceptible, 1 represents infected)
                           
        random choice 1(p=1-gamma) or 2(p=gamma) and change the value of this point
        (1 represents stay infected, 2 represents recovered)
        
    if time point = 10 or 50 or 100:
        plot

How will you find the infected points? 
-Use where() function that numpy provides.

For each infected point, how do you address all its neighbours? 
Are there cases where this could be difficult?
-Details seen above

How do you check that neighbours are not recovered?
-The value of that point is equal to 0

How do you infect the neighbours?
-Random choice 0 or 1 with certain probability and change the value of that point

How do you allow infected individuals to recover?
-Randome choic 1 or 2 with certain probability and change the value of that point

How can you plot the outcome? 
-At chosen time point(using if), use imshow function to plot
