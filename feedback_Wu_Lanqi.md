# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:


### Feedback Week 3:

The code for week 3 is great. There is no need to change anything.


















### Feedback Week 4:











- [ ] Be a bit more precise about what the mystery code does. It returns just one number, so how does it "find prime numbers" between 1 and 100?








### Feedback Week 5:


- [ ] The code for counting nucleotides and displaying counts in a pie chart works well, but you should ask users to input a nucleotide sequence instead of hard-coding it in the programme.




- [ ] The code for string reverse and sort works fine, but again, ask the user to input a string, instead of hard-coding it.





This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade. 

If this was a summative assessment, you would have scored 90 out of 100
