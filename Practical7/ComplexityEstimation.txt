Input n integers to get 24
Try to find any possible computation among these numbers
No need to output the exact way of how to get 24
Just count how many steps to get 24

Pick 2 numbers in the list (there are n times recursion)
For each pick: 
make 6 operations (a+b, a-b, b-a, a*b, a/b, b/a)
Put the number into the second position to be ready for next recursion
Recurse until one number is left

The overall complexity:
O()=O((n-1)!^n)
